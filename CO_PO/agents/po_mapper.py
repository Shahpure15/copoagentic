Generate CO-PO mappings.

COURSE OUTCOMES:
{co_text}

PROGRAM OUTCOMES:
{po_text}

ADDITIONAL MAPPING INSTRUCTIONS:
{reflection_feedback}

STRICT RULES:
- Mapping strength must be between 0 and 3
- Use 0 if there is no meaningful relationship
- Use 1 for weak relationship
- Use 2 for moderate relationship
- Use 3 for strong relationship

NBA REQUIREMENTS:
- Ensure PO1, PO2, and PO3 receive strong mappings
- Avoid assigning all mappings randomly
- Ensure logical alignment
- Maintain academic relevance
- Ensure at least 2 strong mappings for major POs

CONFIDENCE SCORE:
- Must be between 0 and 1

RETURN FORMAT:
Return ONLY valid JSON array.

Example:
[
  {{
    "co_id": "CO1",
    "po_id": "PO1",
    "strength": 3,
    "reasoning": "CO1 strongly supports engineering knowledge",
